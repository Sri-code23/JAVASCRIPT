To make your Python library available globally, you need to publish it to PyPI (Python Package Index). Here’s how you can do that:

Steps to Publish Your Library to PyPI

1. Create the Project Structure

Ensure your project follows this structure:

webpage_generator/
├── webpage_generator/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── generator.py
├── setup.py
├── pyproject.toml
├── README.md
├── LICENSE


---

2. Modify generator.py for CLI Usage

Update your generator.py to accept a project name argument:

import os
import sys

def create_project():
    """Creates a basic webpage project structure with HTML, CSS, and JS."""
    if len(sys.argv) < 2:
        print("Usage: create-webpage <project_name>")
        sys.exit(1)

    name = sys.argv[1]
    
    structure = {
        "index.html": "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n<title>Web Project</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n<h1>Welcome</h1>\n</body>\n</html>",
        "style.css": "body { font-family: Arial, sans-serif; margin: 20px; }",
        "script.js": "console.log('Hello, Web Project!');"
    }

    os.makedirs(name, exist_ok=True)
    for filename, content in structure.items():
        with open(os.path.join(name, filename), "w") as f:
            f.write(content)

    print(f"Project '{name}' created successfully!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    create_project()


---

3. Create setup.py

This will allow your package to be installed and executed globally.

from setuptools import setup, find_packages

setup(
    name="webpage-generator",
    version="0.1.0",
    packages=find_packages(),
    entry_points={
        "console_scripts": [
            "create-webpage=webpage_generator.generator:create_project",
        ],
    },
    install_requires=[],
    author="Your Name",
    author_email="your_email@example.com",
    description="A simple CLI tool to generate a webpage project structure",
    long_description=open("README.md").read(),
    long_description_content_type="text/markdown",
    url="https://github.com/yourusername/webpage-generator",
    classifiers=[
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
        "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    ],
    python_requires=">=3.6",
)


---

4. Add pyproject.toml

This ensures the package is built correctly.

[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools", "wheel"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"


---

5. Build and Upload to PyPI

1. Install required tools:

pip install setuptools wheel twine


2. Build the package:

python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel


3. Upload to PyPI:

twine upload dist/*

Enter your PyPI credentials when prompted.

6. Install and Use It Globally

Once uploaded, anyone can install it globally using:

pip install webpage-generator

Then, run it from anywhere:

create-webpage my_project

Next Steps

Do you want to include customizable templates?

Would you like an interactive CLI version where users can choose file contents?
